# iterated-prisoner-s-dilemma-simulation
This program simulates the iterated prisoner’s dilemma by making every patch play against neighbouring patches. The different strategies are visualized by different colours (see code).

# HOW IT WORKS 
Every patch starts of with a strategy depending on the configuration (manipulated by the sliders). Every patch plays against the 8 neighbouring patches. After an n-total of rounds the best strategy of the 8 gets evaluated, the patch in the middle will take on the highest scoring strategy.

# HOW TO USE IT 
Change the parameters to your liking. After you’ve done this press “SETUP” and then “GO” to run the program. Via the parameters you can manipulate various things like the total of rounds each patch plays, the amount of noise, the pay-off table and the distribution of the different strategies.

# THINGS TO NOTICE 
When pressing the “SETUP” button the screen does not seem to refresh. Rest assured that it actually is, but you need to press the “GO” button first. It can also help to change the parameters a little bit.

# THINGS TO TRY 
Try changing the parameters a little bit, for example: Try to create a Sierpiński carpet (like the snapshot but better haha)
